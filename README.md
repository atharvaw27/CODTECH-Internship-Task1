# Overview of the Project

**Objective**

This Python program functions as a basic calculator that allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Features**

**1)User-Friendly Interface:**

Prompts the user for input in a clear and structured way.

**2)Operations Supported:**

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/) with handling for division by zero.

**3)Input Validation:**

Ensures numbers are entered as valid floats.

Provides an error message for invalid operation choices.

**4)Interactive Flow:**

Guides the user step-by-step through selecting inputs and operations.

Displays the result after performing the selected calculation.

**Error Handling:**

Invalid Numeric Input: Provides feedback if non-numeric values are entered.

Division by Zero: Safeguards against invalid arithmetic operations.

**Code Design:**

Encapsulated in a single function calculator().

Organized using if-elif conditions to handle different operations.

Includes a main guard (if __name__ == "__main__":) to ensure modularity for reuse in other scripts.
